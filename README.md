# T23_Lvl03-Machine_Learning-Capstone
poly.py has data points for the weight of males at different ages. The data was obtained from [here](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtage.htm#males). 

The program uses 16 training points and 5 testing points to train both a linear function as well as two polynomial functions, quadratic and cubic, to create a best fit line.

## Functions
The data is used, processes and the program provides a single figure as display output to the user. This figure has 4 elements shown on it:

- Test data as a scatter plot, which is used as a sanity check
- Linear line
- Quadratic line (polynomial with a power of 2)
- Cubic line (polynomial with a power of 3)

## Use
This program is useful to anyone who want to understand the difference between accuracy and polynomial functions verses linear functions.
